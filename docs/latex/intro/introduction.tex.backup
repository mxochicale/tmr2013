\chapter{Introduction}


Ubiquitous computing is based on a new family of devices 
bywhich their information is thoroughly integrated into everyday objects and activities. 
These devices are sensors for measuring diferent physical phenomenons.
% such as video, acceleration, and even wireless comunication.
Thus, it is possible to create interfaces that merge human-wereable devices 
with a mobile robot, promoting human-robot interactions.
However the majority of such HRI are aimed at 
the home activities and are not suitable for 
common social interactions such as dancing.

To address this concern, we developed a human-robot interface dance demo in which 
a single-accelerometer sensor board is werared on the user's left wrist 
in order to detect four diferent gestures by using statistical theory. 
% a the arm movements of the user are going to detect movements 

This technical report describes the connection of the ZSTAR3 sensor board accelerometer
with the pionerbot robot for gesture recognition.
Methods for hand gesture recognition based accereation signals using Statistical Theory are described first;
and a simple control strategy for the dance demo performance.
Finally, discussion and suggestions
for future work are given together with conclusions.

% Results and Discussion

% Thus, we attempt to integrate gait analysis technology with
% accelerometer and gyroscope to create a novel dancing game.
% We place interface devices onto pants and socks and derive
% input signals based on the movement of hips and feet when
% playing the game. Also using ubiquitous wireless network to
% gather signals from wearable sensors, the player can explore
% the virtual world without being limited by the sitting down or
% standing up position on the same spot due to the constraints of
% fixed equipment and wires.


% Our initial goal was targeted in rehabilitation and home
% healthcare [1][2][3]. We have further made it into a dance
% game [4]. To detect the movement of lower limb has been a
% key technology in rehab, now it may be applied to interactive
% games. In our previous studies, we applied digital textile
% sensors to detect posture or estimate human gait. On the other
% fronts, we have realized much research has disclosed body
% movement detection systems based on wearable accelerometer
% and gyroscope.



% Novel input techniques have received popular attention in
% computer game research since the spread of Wii by Nintendo.

% With augmented reality, one can create interfaces that merge
% virtual objects and signal data with the real world, promoting
% flexible people-machine and people-people interactions. 







% The bibliographic entries are to be kept in a file named
% \verb|<something>.bib|. In this sample report we call it as
% \verb|mylit.bib|. This file must be included without the \verb|.bib|
% extension in the main file as: \verb|\bibliography{mylit}|.   Open the
% file \verb|mylit.bib| to see the format in which the entries are
% written. This is written in the Bib\TeX format. Most of the
% bibliographic web pages (Scopus, ISI Web) and software (EndNote, etc)
% allow you to export bibliographic entries in the Bib\TeX format.
% 
% Citations are referred in the text using \verb|\citet| command which produces
% citations as though they are part of the text.  In order to say
% somebody did this work as a part of a line use: \verb|\citet{Auth09}|
% have done extensive work on \ldots.  

% This will produce
% 
% \citet{Auth09} have done extensive work on \ldots
% 
% 
% Alternately citations can appear in parenthesis.  The
% command \verb|\citep{Auth09}| is used to automatically put the
% citations in parenthesis.
%   As an example consider the extensive work
% done in the area of book writing \citep{Mono08,Auth09}.


% This document contains commonly used essential templates to write a
% \LaTeX\ document. This document is to be used along with the files and
% folders provided. Writing a \LaTeX\ document is very simple.  Often
% students need only very simple constructs.  This document shows
% certain essential features that almost all technical report writing
% requires. Please consult the PDF file for the output of the document,
% and then look at the corresponding \LaTeX\ file to reproduce it.  The
% document illustrates the following constructs
% \begin{itemize}
% \item Unnumbered and Numbered Lists
% \item Equations
% \item Defining short macros for frequently used symbols
% \item Bibliography
% \item Figures
% \item Tables
% \end{itemize}
% 
% The normal procedure for compiling a \LaTeX\ document that contains
% bibliographic entries is to follow the following steps
% \begin{enumerate}
% \item \verb|latex mainrep|
% \item \verb|bibtex mainrep|
% \item \verb|latex mainrep|
% \item \verb|latex mainrep|
% \end{enumerate}
% In the above example \verb|mainrep| is the main \LaTeX\ file.

% \section{First section of this chapter}
% 
% This is the first chapter, which resides in a directory (folder)
% intro. Each chapter can contain \verb|section|, \verb|subsection|
% and so on.
% 
% \subsection{Equations and Math symbols}
% 
% 
% Equations should be set in a separate mode.  For details on getting
% various types of aligned equations, consult the \AmS-\LaTeX\
% documentation \verb|amsldoc.pdf|. Simple equations are set as
% \begin{equation}
% \label{eq:sinx}
% \int \mathrm{d}x \; \cos x =  \sin x
% \end{equation}
% Equation~\eqref{eq:sinx} is the integral of the cosine
% function. Mathematical symbols must always be put inside \verb|$$|,
% when they appear outside a math environment (such as \verb|equation|,
% \verb|align|, \verb|gather|, etc).  The symbol ``ex'' must be written as
% $x$ and not as x.  
% 
% Another commonly used construct for equations is the \verb|align|
% environment to align several equations along a vertical line. It is
% usually the $=$ sign across which the alignment is done.  The
% point of alignment for each equation is specified using the ampersand symbol 
% \begin{align}
% a &= b  \\
% a + e + f + g & = m + n + z \\
% x + 2 & = x^{3} + 3 x^{2} + 2 x + 5
% \end{align}
% 
% \subsection{Commonly used Symbols}
% For mathematical symbols it is very convenient to define frequently
% used symbols as a short macro. For example if you are to be using the
% symbol $\eta_{\mathrm{s}}$ frequently it is convenient to define it in
% as:\\
% \verb|\newcommand{\etas}{\ensuremath{\eta_{\mathrm{s}}}}| \\
% in the preamble and to simply refer it to in the text as \etas\ or in
% a mathematical equation as $\etas = \eta \, ( 1 + \phi)$.
