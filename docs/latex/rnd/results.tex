\chapter{Conclusions}


We have presented an HRI Dance Demo 
which is tailored to deal with the challenges of a real-time Human-Robot Interaction entertainment application.
It was presented satisfactorily at the 2013 Mexican Tournament of Robotics.
One future direction motivated by this work 
is to add four wireless sensors in order 
to distinguish different dance patterns, and, then, 
the robot will have been capable of suggesting a musical genre according the 
user's movements.
