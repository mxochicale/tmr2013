## 1. Introduction
This work presents a Human-Robot Interation (HRI) Dance Demo, which is based
on a ZSTAR3 Radio Frequency single three-axis accelerometer and a Patrolbot
mobile robot. The ZSTAR3 sensor board is located in the position of the userâ€™s
left wrist. With the wereable accelerometer, we explores four movements of the
arm in order to control the mobile robot


## 2. Documentation
Further information is available at the [HRIDD.pdf](/docs/latex/HRIDD.pdf) document.


## 3. Quick Start

```
  1. Turn on the Pioneer Mobile Robot
  2. Connect the Aria USB Connector and the ZSTAR USB Stick
  3. The user must wear strictly the USB sensor board on his/her left wrist 
  4. Turn on the sensor board by pushing any of the three white 
     pushbuttons.
  5. Finally, go to the dancedemoapp directory and run the application
     as a administrator with
     $ sudo ./dancedemoapp
```
